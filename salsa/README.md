# Salsa: Implementation

Salsa is a very efficient protocol whose the execution can be done directly on a laptop if desired.

To execute Salsa and obtain the execution time, please be sure that **Rust** and **Cargo** are installed.
If not, you may refer to the Rust page installation.

To build and run the software, execute the following command:
```sh
cargo run --release
```
The output of this command are located in several CSV files.
